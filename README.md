# MyFirstNeuralNetwork


### Desciption

Neural network in charge of generating images based on the layers and neurons that are modified in code in addition to the calculation of the sigmoid function based on values entered by console.

### Prerequisites and installations

1. numpy
2. matplotlib

To install numpy: 
`pip install numpy`


To install matplotlib: 
`pip install matplotlib`


### Run the algorithm

To start the algorithm just go to the folder where the `image_generator_neural_network.py` file is located and run the following command:

`python image_generator_neural_network.py`
